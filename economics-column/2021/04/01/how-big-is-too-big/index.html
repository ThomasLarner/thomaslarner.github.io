                he recent events in the Suez Canal, in my opinion, have shone a light on the increasing strain on
                maritime infrastructure caused by the ever enlarging ships, and sheer volume of cargo transported by the
                sea per day.
            </p>
            <p>Since the Ever Given ran aground in the Suez Canal on 23rd March 2021, the nearly quarter-mile long,
                220,000 ton ship held up an estimated $9.6bn of traffic per day (however these are some extreme back of
                the envelope calculations). Surely this is a sign that the global shipping industry is balancing on a
                very thin knife edge. One seemingly small incident (a ship becoming stuck) has had a huge impact on
                global trade in just under one week, and will continue to put strain on ports for the near future as
                they struggle to cope with all the delayed cargo.</p>
            <p>I have been following the situation in the Suez Canal, and my research has prompted the question, How Big
                is Too Big with regards to ships.</p>
            <p>In 2014/15 the Suez Canal underwent a $8.2bn expansion which gave the passageway a parallel channel to
                help it cope with the sheer volume of traffic. However at the time of the expansion the biggest ships
                were 19,000TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit, i.e. the number of 20ft containers a ship can hold), and at
                the time of the opening of the canal in 1869, well I'm sure ships were much smaller then. But now the
                biggest ships are almost 24,000TEU and these are only going to get bigger. This is because of the
                economies of scale a bigger ship can offer i.e. you can build a much bigger container ship without
                needing a much bigger crew or a much bigger engine or using much more fuel.</p>
            <p>You only have to look at the situation in American ports to realise that even they are struggling to cope
                with these enormous ships. In 2013 Miami spent 2 years and $205m deepening their port by 8ft to
                accommodate increasingly larger ships. 2 years later they requested a new dredging plan to deepen the
                port even more. This is not only happening at Miami, but at the Port of Boston, Los Angeles, New York,
                Mobile and Charleston.</p>
            <p>But why is this happening. Ultimately, this is down to a few of the large shipping companies (who wish to
                benefit from the economies of scale of larger ships) wanting to use shipping routes and ports, and of
                course, the ports want to accept these ships. However, it seems that the ports are always playing
                catch-up. This is dangerous as, as we have seen in the Suez Canal there is a period of time between
                expansions when the infrastructure simply cannot cope.</p>
            <p>So after all this, what is going to happen? In the interest of preventing more ships from getting stuck
                in one of the worldâ€™s most important canals, the Suez Canal Authority should probably put restrictions
                on the size of the ships that are allowed to pass through. However, as a result of pressure from the
                shipping companies who do not want to send their ships around the whole of Africa and all the revenue
                that the Suez Canal Authority would lose out on, I very much doubt this will happen. They should also
                look at further expanding the canal too, but seeing as the previous expansion did not increase capacity
                by the predicted amount, this will probably not happen for a long time. Until then 12% of the world's
                trade is relying on good weather, the competence of the canal's pilots, and avoiding any potential
                mechanical failure from anyone of the ships passing through the canal.</p>
            <p>So to answer my question, How Big is Too Big, well as the world's infrastructure is already on the verge
                of breaking point, I think we have already reached that point for now. But the increasing demand and
                need for importing goods and world trade will only push these boundaries until either A: We improve our
                infrastructure or B: We experience another saga like the Ever Given.</p>
