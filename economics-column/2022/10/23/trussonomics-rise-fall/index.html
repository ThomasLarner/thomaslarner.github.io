            <hr>
            <p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen Liz Truss campaigned for Tory party leader, she set out a vision for
                Britain that promised growth, fuelled by low taxes and deregulation, breaking away from “Treasury
                orthodoxy” and carrying out almost Thatcherite-like reforms. Branded “Trussonomics”, this was supposed
                to be the path that solved many of Britain’s underlying economic problems. However, after only three
                weeks into her tenure, it became apparent it was all a fairy-tale after all, just as her campaign rival,
                and replacement Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak had predicted.</p>
            <p><b>The Rise</b></p>
            <p>Over the last decade, Britain has jumped many economic hurdles: Brexit, at least so far, has created more
                red tape for businesses, hampering exports and trade; the COVID crisis, which has raised unemployment
                and inactivity in the workforce; and the recent cost of living crisis and supply side constraints
                threaten to plunge the UK into recession.</p>
            <p>So, what is going on?</p>
            <p>Well, as Liz Truss would say, Britain’s underlying economic failures have been a by-product of low
                growth, and inactivity from the establishment, who accept the UK is facing an inevitable economic
                decline.</p>
            <p>So when she had the chance to stand for leader of the Conservative party, after Boris’ resignation, she
                set out her radical plan to lead Britain back to high growth. This, she said, would cure the UK’s
                economy, and importantly help the UK mitigate a near-term recession.</p>
            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasLarner11/status/1551665776465256449" class="colour_link">I was
                    critical</a> of her plans to cut taxes during a period of historically high inflation. Suggesting
                that this would only fuel more spending and inflation, prompting the Bank of England to raise rates
                further, not only harming people with mortgages but also the government's ability to borrow cheaply.
                This, I believed, would plunge the UK into recession.</p>
            <p>However, I do agree with her supply side reforms, which compliment the BoE’s cooling inflation agenda and
                would also promote long-term growth in the future. I think borrowing money in order to carry out these
                reforms is also perfectly acceptable as they will help to generate more income through higher GDP down
                the line.</p>
            <p><b>The Fall</b></p>
            <p>The fall of Trussonomics came at the very beginning. The start of her radical, pro-growth plans were
                unveiled at her not-so-mini-mini-budget, where it quickly became apparent that growth sounds all well
                and good, until you actually start doing it.</p>
            <p>The immediate fallout were drastic falls in GBP, and a sell off of gilts. Later on, the Bank of England
                had to reverse any of it’s hopes of QT, and started buying gilts to try to supress yields. This all
                suggested that investors and markets did not like Truss’ budget. Remember, that it is these very
                investors who Truss needs to borrow from in order to carry out her expensive reforms.</p>
            <p>It is important to note, and perhaps this is something that has been missing from many media reports, is
                that the reason pension funds were having to fire sell gilts was not necessarily because they had lost
                confidence in the government, but rather to meet margin calls. I think it would have been an easy
                oversight for Truss and Kwarteng to miss the fact that pension funds were jacked up with leverage, due
                to their complex hedging strategies. Even Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P.Morgan, said he was surprised at the
                sheer amount of leverage in the pension industry. This is something that has been overlooked in the
                media, but also not something to distract from the fundamentally flawed budget.</p>
            <img src="/assets/charts/truss_budget_comparison.png" class="blog_image_float_left">
            <p>In hindsight, it was a bad idea to <a href="/charts/2022/09/30/truss-mini-budget-comparisons/"
                    class="colour_link">announce all her policies in one go</a>. Her tax cuts, which totalled £146bn
                over 5 years, and her borrowing plans that were at levels similar to budgets during the 2008 financial
                crisis were simply too much for the markets to swallow in one gulp.</p>
            <p>U-turns were therefore inevitable, despite the fact Truss should have stuck to her guns, she sacked her
                chancellor and then reversed almost her entire budget with her new chancellor Jeremy Hunt.</p>
            <p>At that point, resignation was a matter of when, not if.</p>
            <p>She resigned after only 44 days in office. Such was the epic downfall of Trussonomics.</p>
