            <hr>
            <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the FOMC meeting last Wednesday, the Fed was very clear in its rhetoric
                that they are prepared to continue to hike until inflation is sufficiently quelled. They raised their
                Fed funds rate by 50 basis points, which was inline with expectations. However, their dot plot now
                projects a peak median rate of 5.1% for 2023, up from the current median of 4.375%. This surprised
                investors and further rate hikes would have negative implications for US equities and bonds as returns
                elsewhere become more attractive.</p>
            <p>However… Federal funds futures contracts, a derivative that traders can use to speculate on Fed rate
                hikes and cuts, suggests that rates have already peaked at this last meeting and that the Fed will, in
                fact, be cutting rates from 2023 onwards.</p>
            <p>The markets believe that the US economy is walking straight into a recession and that will be the
                ultimate force to supress inflation. Historically, recessions have been the best way to quickly bring
                down inflation and whilst this isn&apos;t a Fed policy, they seem to weight fighting inflation with
                extreme
                tightening over causing a slow down or contraction in the economy.</p>
            <p>In the press conference following the meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was very specific in singling out
                the labour market as a key contributor to inflation. This is because, out of the Fed&apos;s three
                inflation
                categories (housing, ex-housing core goods, and ex-housing core services) the one they have their focus
                on, ex-housing core services, is significantly influenced by labour costs as labour is a major input to
                services industries. This category is susceptible to wage-price spirals.</p>
            <img src="/assets/charts/us_labour_mkt_shortage_nov22.png" class="blog_image_float_left">
            <p>The US is suffering from a chronic labour shortage at the moment. They are roughly 4.4million workers
                short. This is making it hard for firms to hire new people, which is forcing them to hold onto staff
                even as we move into a period of slow (or no) economic growth. Apart from in the technology sector,
                which is suffering from their own problems, the labour market is very tight, and this puts upward
                pressures on wages which is then passed on to consumers through higher goods and services prices
                (causing inflation).</p>
            <p>There are two things that could cause wage pressures to cool:</p>
            <p>First, demand for labour decreases. This could be as a result of Fed tightening, leaving firms with less
                cash for spending; or, as labour is a derived demand, if demand for the services and goods decreases
                (again as a result of Fed tightening). This is the ideal situation for the Fed as it leaves people with
                less money in their pocket for discretionary spending, which is a driver of inflation.</p>
            <p>Or second, the labour supply increases. This seems unlikely given the current shortages, however, is not
                out of the question. The early retirees from the COVID pandemic, who are largely to blame for these
                shortages, may be forced to return to work as they feel the pinch from inflation. This would be the
                eventuality the Fed doesn&apos;t want as this would only put more money in people&apos;s pockets, which
                would full
                circle back into the economy, fuelling demand pull inflation.</p>
            <p>I find the first option both more likely and more desirable for the Fed, but it is a tough reality to
                face. The Fed needs people to have less money to spend and for unemployment to rise. They essentially
                need a recession. Remember, bringing down inflation is their target and ultimately that is what will
                restore creditability, whether or not a recession occurs.</p>
            <p>Despite the insistence that a soft landing is still possible, they revised down their GDP growth
                forecasts to 0.5%, which to me sounds like they are losing confidence in the soft landing too.</p>
            <p>We will wait to see if the market out-plays the Fed, and what the Fed&apos;s next move will be, but
                whatever
                it is, the outcome it is looking like a bleak one, at least in the short-term.</p>
