            <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you, or I were to spend more than we earn, we would have to take out a
                loan to cover the rest.</p>
            <p>The US government’s cash flow runs on the same principle; they have spent more than their earnings for
                every year since 2002, and for most years before that. As a result, the Treasury has amassed a whopping
                $31.4trn in Federal debt to make up the difference.</p>
            <img src="/assets/charts/what-debt-ceiling.png" class="blog_image_float_left">
            <p>But, just like our credit cards, they have a credit limit, known as the “debt ceiling”. This is a legal
                limit on the amount of borrowing the government can do, designed to prevent administrations from going
                on unlimited spending sprees. This legal limit does not, however, prevent them from getting very close
                to it, or as it happened on 19<sup>th</sup> January, reaching it.</p>
            <p>Unlike most other countries, America debates the government’s spending and borrowing plans separately,
                which usually causes a mis-match between the two. Imagine taking out a mortgage without knowing the
                value of the house you plan to buy – if you could do such a thing. Eventually, they have to re-debate
                the debt ceiling to be able to fund their current projects and their current expenses, such as social
                security.</p>
            <p>This is not the first time in history that they have reached the limit and the usual procedure would be
                to just agree a raise in the ceiling, and kick the can down the road till the next time – something that
                has happened 78 times since 1960.</p>
            <p>But this time is different.</p>
            <p>The Democrats and President Biden, who believe in big government, think that the debt ceiling should be
                raised without question, arguing that any extra borrowing would be used to fund already agreed projects
                and policies.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the Republicans, who now control the House and favour small government by reducing the
                fiscal deficit, are demanding Biden and the Democrats rein in their spending to balance the books,
                before any talk of raising the debt ceiling can take place – hence the standoff.</p>
            <p>Eventually, the debt ceiling will need to be raised. The counterfactual is simply not in the question.
                The US government would have to default on it’s debt obligations and stop paying pensioners, soldiers
                and others who rely on social security payments.</p>
            <p>A default would undoubtedly cause a sell-off of Treasuries, which would have a similar effect to the
                sell-off of British gilts last September, but on a greater magnitude. Like the pound did, the dollar,
                which has already weakened this year, would drop further as overseas investors lose confidence in it as
                the global reserve currency – adding to inflationary pressures as imported goods from China become
                relatively more expensive for Americans. Yields on government debt would sky rocket, making it more
                expensive for them to borrow in the future, or to refinance their current debt. This would make running
                a fiscal deficit untenable in the future, as it would simply be too expensive – harming America’s long
                term growth.</p>
            <p>A default would send a tidal wave of volatility through global financial markets as foreign investors
                hold over $7.4trn of the stuff and Treasury Notes make up a large portion of collateral banks use for
                loans. BYN Mellon found that collateral in 2008 was composed of $1.8trn in cash, and $1.3trn in other
                securities (such as Treasuries), and a decade later only $870bn in cash was posted, compared to $1.6trn
                in non-cash. Therefore, higher yields on US Treasuries would trickle down to consumer and bank lending –
                harming the consumer already pinched by high interest rates.</p>
            <p>The US has never defaulted on its debt before and therefore the consequences of such a thing are
                incomprehensible, after all it should be the ultimate risk free asset, right? The closest they have
                come, however, was in 2011. Just like now, the newly elected Republican House sought to force President
                Obama into reducing the deficit. It was only two days before the projected default that they finally
                caved in to raising the limit, but by then the damage was already done. That was one of the most
                volatile weeks in the financial markets since 2008, and S&P downgraded the government's credit rating to
                AA+ from AAA – a slap in the face for the US which caused a sell off of equities, now known as the Black
                Monday of 2011.</p>
            <p>Some believe the limit should be scrapped. But just think what would happen if Amex removed your credit
                limit; one thing is for sure, credit card interest rates would be far higher than the 20% they are now
                to counterbalance the extra risk.</p>
            <p>The government should use this time’s debt ceiling debate to make serious commitments to reduce debt to
                GDP over the medium to long term. The era of running wild fiscal deficits and riding on low interest
                rates is now over and governments around the world should wake up to this new reality.</p>
