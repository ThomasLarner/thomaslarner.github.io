                peculation over China’s reopening dominated China-talk last year, with everyone patiently waiting for
                China to come bursting out of its gates and to unleash its economy on the world.</p>
            <p><a
                    href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/chinas-reopening-is-poised-to-boost-global-growth.html" class="colour_link">Goldman
                    Sachs</a>, for one, have identified 3 main “channels” through which China will help to boost global
                growth in 2023, in a report released in February. They expect China’s increased domestic demand,
                international travel and commodity demand to help raise global GDP by roughly 1% in 2023.</p>
            <p>However, amid heightened tensions between the United States and China; lacking confidence in the country
                and their increasing turn to cheap Russian commodities, we must be careful not to assume these channels
                will lead to USD.</p>
            <p class="blog_sub_heading">“Revenge spending”</p>
            <img src="/assets/charts/china_savings_glut_2022.png" class="blog_image_float_left">
            <p>From inside the country, there was talk of pent-up demand that was bursting at the seams and of consumers
                that were eager to spend their colossal pandemic savings. The average Chinese household saved over a
                third of their income last year, compare that to American’s 3.3% last year and only 17% during the
                locked-down year of 2020.</p>
            <p>In February, however, retail sales disappointed and were down slightly by 0.02% MoM. Gasoline prices
                popped by 7% on a month-to-month basis, suggesting that the people are getting out, but may be
                hesitating about parting with their cash – highlighting the low consumer confidence in the wake of
                zero-Covid.</p>
            <p>Once confidence does return, I still think much of their spending will be done on goods made by firms
                based in Asia. After all, China is “the world’s factory” and produce most of their own goods; of what
                they do import, significantly more comes from Asia than from western countries.</p>
            <p>It is also possible that these savings will be put aside for a rainy day. Since the removal of zero-Covid
                policies, the government has refined the definition of Covid – making it harder for patients to claim on
                their health insurance for Covid treatment. Some hospitals have been <a
                    href="https://www.ft.com/content/c049eb2d-4455-4ed3-b775-2c6818ec5737" class="colour_link">reportedly charging thousands
                    of dollars per day</a>
                for treatment, which during the days of zero-Covid would have been state supported in
                many provinces. Many people may continue to build up savings in case Covid cases start to rise again.
            </p>
            <p class="blog_sub_heading">International holidays</p>
            <p>Now that quarantine rules for returning travellers to the mainland have been scrapped, there has been
                speculation that there will be an increase in international travel from China in 2023. Thailand, for
                one, is expecting somewhere between <a
                    href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/china-reopening-could-boost-2023-global-economy" class="colour_link">7
                    and 10 million</a> travellers from China this year, which is still
                slightly down from pre-pandemic levels, but should still provide a nice little boost to Thailand’s GDP.
            </p>
            <img src="/assets/charts/us_china_visas_to_jan23.png" class="blog_image_float_left">
            <p>However, visa data from the United States suggests that travellers were initially, at least, slow to
                apply for tourism visas. In January, there were 13,300 tourism visa applications from China, compared to
                54,000 in January 2020. Considering that it is recommended you apply for a visa three months in advance
                of travelling, the overall picture from the data released so far suggests there will be a slow pick-up
                in demand for travelling to the US in 2023. This can be put down to a couple of factors.</p>
            <p>Firstly, US-China tensions have <a
                    href="https://airlineweekly.com/2023/01/geopolitics-get-in-way-of-resuming-u-s-china-flights-as-demand-surges/" class="colour_link">created
                    a stalemate</a> over flight permits to and from the countries.
                Chinese airlines have submitted requests for ramping up flights to the US, but sources suggest that the
                Department of Transport is unlikely to approve these until their Chinese counterparts similarly approve
                US airline requests.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is still uncertainty over travel restrictions. Whilst quarantine rules have been
                scrapped, Malaysia’s AirAsia X airline are reportedly still struggling to sell tickets to Chinese
                travellers, <a
                    href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-22/china-travel-demand-fails-to-pick-up-despite-reopening-airasia-x-says" class="colour_link">reporting
                    that they can only fill half of their available seats</a>, owing to a lack of
                uncertainty over the rules if you were to test positive on your return.</p>
            <p>No doubt travel will eventually rebound, just like it has for countries who ditched covid rules long ago,
                but we won’t see a major rebound until Q3/4, accounting for the three month lag and the time it takes
                for travellers to gain more confidence that there will be no sudden changes to the restrictions.</p>
            <p class="blog_sub_heading">Commodity prices</p>
            <p>The third channel that Goldman Sachs identifies is a rise in demand for commodities, such as oil, as
                production lines fire up in the country. There will certainly be an increase in demand for oil, as
                mentioned already, gasoline prices have been rising – suggesting an underlying increase in demand for
                petrol and diesel, which is a result of removing lockdown restrictions.</p>
            <p>There are two sides to this: Commodity exporting nations should benefit from extra demand which would
                translate into higher prices and profits; whilst, net importers of commodities would pay the price.</p>
            <img src="/assets/charts/china_buys_more_russian_crude.png" class="blog_image_float_left">
            <p>However, China is increasingly turning to Russian crude oil, due to its low price – a product of western
                sanctions. According to Refinitiv, China increased its imports of Russian crude from 1.52 million bpd in
                December to 2.03 million bpd in January. Considering that the Goldman report says they expect a 1
                million bpd increase in aggregate Chinese demand for crude over the whole of 2023, it would seem that
                Russia has already fulfilled half of this already. With reports that China is also <a
                    href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/06/energy/china-russian-gas-payments-ruble-yuan/index.html" class="colour_link">settling
                    oil contracts in Rubles and Yuan</a>, this further moves capital away from USD.</p>
            <p>Russia’s disconnectedness from the global oil market, a result of sanctions, means that it is tricky to
                predict how Chinese demand for oil will affect the global price of oil. In OPEC’s meeting in October,
                they agreed to cut production by <a
                    href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-seen-sticking-with-oil-output-policy-delegates-say-2023-02-01/" class="colour_link">2
                    million bpd</a> for the whole of 2023, suggesting that they are taking
                the “wait and see” approach too. Demand from the rest of the world may slow this year, due to the
                economic climate in the west, which might make room for extra Chinese demand within the current supply.
            </p>
            <p>If oil demand does rise significantly, then net importers of oil will face higher import costs. This will
                likely stoke inflation higher, perhaps prompting more monetary policy action in many western countries.
                But much of China’s demand for oil may depend on demand for its goods by these western nations, who are
                already hit with inflation and slowing economic conditions.</p>
            <p class="blog_sub_heading">Wait and see</p>
            <p>There is immense uncertainty surrounding China’s reopening. Yes, over the one to two year horizon, demand
                for travel, commodities and domestic demand will recover, and China will probably help to boost global
                GDP in 2023. However, the China-bulls are wrong to expect a flick-of-the-switch return to pre-pandemic
                conditions. China’s modest 5% growth target indicates the wariness of Chinese officials about the level
                of confidence in the economy at present – a sign that we should be wary too.</p>
            <p>We must also be careful that in this increasingly disjointed version of globalisation that we find
                ourselves in, not to assume China’s reopening will help western countries as much as itself, its BRICS
                allies and its regional trade partners, who will benefit from closer diplomatic ties with China. A stark
                contrast to the United States’ current foreign policy.</p>
