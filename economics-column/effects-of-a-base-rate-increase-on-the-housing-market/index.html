            <hr>
            <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he COVID19 Pandemic has opened up the gap between house prices and wages to
                levels not seen in recent history, and could continue to widen even after the pandemic, causing vast
                inequality in the economy.</p>
            <img src="/assets/charts/bank_mortgage_rate_2021.png" class="blog_image_float_left">
            <p>Since 2008, mortgage rates have been steadily falling due to their relationship with the base rate. The
                base rate, set by the Bank of England, is at a historical low in order to provide support to the economy
                during the pandemic.</p>
            <p>These extremely low borrowing costs combined with short term factors brought about by response to the
                pandemic have sent house prices soaring.</p>
            <p>The first factor that has contributed to the high demand for housing is the Stamp Duty Holiday, that
                operated between July 2020 and June 2021 (tapering off until 30th September 2021). Meaning a house buyer
                could have saved up to £15,000 worth of tax on a house purchase. By removing the tax, supply was shifted
                leading to more demand for homes. However, upon the tax break drawing to a close, average house prices
                decreased by £10,000 in a month. Not only is this proof that the plan worked as intended – stimulating
                the housing market (albeit too much), the fact that Stamp Duties are now back to normal will have a
                positive effect on the list prices of homes.</p>
            <p>The second factor is the demand for extra space during the height of the pandemic, which is a result of 3
                national lockdowns. This caused a shift from city apartments to countryside dwellings. Once, however,
                people begin to move back to the cities the effects of this factor will be reduced, nevertheless it is a
                major contributor to high house prices.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the pandemic has also had huge implications on the global supply chain, causing prices of raw
                materials to sky rocket, this combined with the shortage of workers, increases the costs to build homes,
                which are then passed on to consumers in the form of higher list prices.</p>
            <img src="/assets/charts/house_prices_rise_during_pandemic.png" class="blog_image_float_left">
            <p>The government are also intervening as there are negative externalities in the housing market, whilst for
                safety reasons and environmental reasons, these may be necessary steps, they will also cause unwanted
                rises in house prices in the future.</p>
            <p>Firstly, Boris Johnson’s hint of a ban on developing greenfield sites. Although there was no substance to
                his announcement, a move by the government to ban such developments would have potentially negative side
                effects on the supply of housing, causing a rise in prices. This is because of the higher costs
                associated with building on already used land, for example, builders may need to remove hazardous waste
                or demolish existing structures. This makes building on fresher greenfield land more appealing. However,
                in the most recent Budget, Rishi Sunak announced that £1.8bn is to be spend on developing brownfield
                land, which may make developing this land more desirable and economically viable for property
                developers, and internalising the negative externalities associated with building on greenfield sites.
            </p>
            <p>There may also be another benefit to this policy too. On the surface it seems as though it will cause
                prices to rise nationwide, however, this policy may lead to the development and rejuvenation of the
                plentiful ex-industrial land in the North and Midlands. Not only helping to reduce the North-South
                divide, but also easing the housing demand pressure on South-Eastern regions.</p>
            <img src="/assets/charts/brownfield_land_map_2021.png" class="blog_image_float_left">
            <p>Secondly, Rishi Sunak’s announcement at the Autumn Budget that there will be a 4% tax on housing
                developers making more than £25m. This would cause a decrease in the supply of housing, thus causing a
                rise in prices.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a move not by the government, but by the Bank of England to raise the base rate to curb
                inflation would lead to higher mortgage costs. The highly anticipated move is likely to happen before
                the end of the year and whilst this may help to reduce the list price of homes, the cost of borrowing
                would rise significantly, causing the total cost of buying a home to remain high.</p>
            <p>The problem arises when house price inflation out competes wage inflation. In recent years and especially
                during the pandemic, the gap between wages and house prices have widened drastically. The house price to
                annual earnings ratio illustrates the gap, and recently reached a high of 9.5.</p>
            <img src="/assets/charts/house_price_wage_ratio_2021.png" class="blog_image_float_left">
            <p>At the beginning of the pandemic, many workers were either put on furlough or laid off, causing a
                decrease in the average weekly wage by £20 (roughly £1000 annually). Whilst in recent months, wages have
                risen as a result of a shortage of workers, house prices have still risen at a faster rate.</p>
            <p>The government’s recent announcement that the National Living Wage will be increased by 6.6% to
                £9.50/hour may help to reduce this widening gap, and as long as the economy is short of workers, wages
                are going to continue to inflate, likely until next year.</p>
            <p>Mind you, higher wages may put more pressure on demand for bigger houses as people upscale, only driving
                up prices again. You win some, you lose some. <span class="fin">●</span></p>
