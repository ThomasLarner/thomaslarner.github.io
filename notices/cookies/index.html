                What Are Cookies?
            </h3>
            <p>
                When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered
                on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for
                example, your computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used
                to identify you personally.
            </p>
            <p>
                These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for
                    every web page requested</li>
                <li>measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough
                    capacity to ensure they are fast</li>
                <li>analysing anonymised data to help us understand how people interact with govt services so we can
                    make them better</li>
            </ul>
