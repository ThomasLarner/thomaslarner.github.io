            <hr>
            <p><span class="dropcap">O</span>n the 1st of April the spread between the 2 year and 10 year treasury was
                negative, which, if history is anything to go by, suggests a recession is round the corner.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, doubt has been cast on the state of the yield curve’s crystal ball power, which has been
                heavily influenced by the Fed’s QE programme. This was designed to lower the yields on longer maturity
                bonds, by buying them up (An increase in demand for these bonds increases the price, thus lowering the
                yield). This has muddied the predictive power of the yield curve since QE began.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the current inflationary pressure and federal reserve likely to increase interest rates further,
                the short maturity bonds have seen an increase in yields. The combo of both factors have flattened the
                curve in the last few months.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether or not a recession occurs will largely come down to the Fed’s ability to engineer a soft-landing
                as they try to control inflation and given the current uncertainty surrounding the supply of energy to
                Europe, whether energy prices continue to rise or not.</p>
