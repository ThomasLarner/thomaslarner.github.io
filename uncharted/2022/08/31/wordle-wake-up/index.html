            <hr>
            <p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne day, I was trying to solve a tricky Wordle; one where the word was
                obscure, and rarely used in daily life. One which I had to look up the definition. This made me think:
                how many other people are looking up this exact same word right now? And surely, more people would
                lookup this word today than any other day?
            </p>
            <p>I was familiar with Google Search Trends, from my research on the <a class="colour_link"
                    href="/research/did-eating-out-really-help-out/">EOHO scheme</a>, so I turned to this to answer my
                question. As it turns out, there was a spike in searches for this word, one that comparatively saw
                basically no ‘Googles’ on a typical day.</p>
            <p>This sent me down a Google search trends hole that eventually led to me realising that Google Search
                Trends would show at what times people play wordle during the day.</p>
            <p>
                At first I looked at the last 24 hours and there was a clear trend with peaks at 12am, 5am and 6am.
                Setting aside the avid Wordlers who stay up till midnight to solve the game at the earliest opportunity,
                the data showed a clear trend of solves between 5am and 6am. Assuming, therefore, that people solve
                Wordle as soon as they wake up, or near abouts, then the majority of Britons, or Wordlers in Britain,
                wake up between 5am and 6am.
            </p>
            <img src="/assets/charts/alarm-time-trends.png" class="blog_image_float_left">
            <p>Some more interesting insights can be derived from this data. Peak searches for Wordle occur an hour
                earlier in the summer than in the winter. Aligning with daylight hour changes. Showing that people wake
                up at least an hour earlier during the warmer months than in the colder ones. </p>

            <p>Also, Midnight on Friday night is a popular time to solve Wordle. Although, I put this down to late
                nights on Friday, rather than an early wake up on Saturday. This trend can be seen in this heat map
                below.</p>

            </div>
            <p>This just shows that if you think outside of the box, you can gain insights from just about anywhere. In
                this case all it took was a few lines of Python and a couple Excel spreadsheets and we could use a
                search trends tool to figure out morning routine trends.</p>
