            <p><span class="dropcap">F</span>or the first time since 1931, General Motors have been outperformed by a
                foreign car manufacturer in their own domestic market. It has been a sub-par year for GM’s US sales, as
                for many sellers, due to a number of supply side constraints and a higher demand for electric vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>GM and many other US manufacturers suffered as a result of the global semi-conductor shortage, caused
                predominantly by the rise in demand for electronic goods, like phones and laptops during lockdowns. This
                caused an industry wide downturn in sales in Q3 as car production had to be slowed. Toyota, however,
                managed to produce cars at a higher rate than its competitors, due to their larger stockpiles of parts,
                including these semi-conductors. These stockpiles date back to a tsunami in 2011, when the firm decided
                to stock more spare parts in case of another natural disaster.</p>
            <p>On top of this, GM’s Chevrolet struggled with some manufacturing defects on its Bolt line of cars,
                prompting a recall, and decreasing demand.</p>
            <p>
                Lastly, the demand for electric vehicles has risen due to the rise in petrol prices in the US. As GM is
                not currently a leader in this field, they suffered as customers flocked elsewhere. This however may
                change in the future as GM has invested $35bn into the development of EVs over the next few years.</p>
